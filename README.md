Machine Learning - Support Vector Regression Example

Real world example used to demonstrate the use of an SVR machine learning model. In this example, an employee was invited for an interview and stated he made $160k for 6.5 years of experience at his old position. This model was developed to ensure the truthfulness of this employees statement. These results were determined in the Polynomial Regression model and compared using this SVR model.
